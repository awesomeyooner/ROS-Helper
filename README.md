# ros README

Hello! This is an extension made to save typing commands like sourcing or building!
When using this extension, please make sure to open the workspace folder you are planning to work in as your main folder.
Example, /home/dev/Documents/projects/my_workspace, please open "my_workspace".

Here are the commands available (so far):

Build Workspace - this builds the active workspace with "colcon build --symlink-install"

Source Workspace - this sources the setup files for your workspace with ". install/setup.bash"

Run - this opens a launch file for the specified package. This works for yaml files only, please be sure to name your launch file "launch.yaml"

There will be more to come!
